# FairLend-Privacy-Preserving-Fair-Loan-Processing Public

## Introduction

This tool is developed to address privacy concerns and possible biases in traditional loan approval processes. The system conceals sensitive personal information, such as gender and caste category, from bank officers to ensure unbiased decision-making based on objective criteria.

## Background

Traditional loan approval processes often involve disclosing sensitive personal information to bank officers, raising privacy concerns and increasing the risk of discrimination based on the applicant's social and demographic background.

## Problem Statement

Studies have shown that gender and caste-based discrimination can influence loan approval decisions, potentially leading to unfair and inequitable outcomes. This has hindered the economic empowerment of women and minorities, particularly in underserved communities.

## Aim
The aim is to design and develop a secure loan verification and approval system that protects sensitive personal information and encourages inclusive financial inclusion.

## Key Objectives
- **Enhance Applicant Privacy:** Conceal sensitive information not directly relevant to the loan approval decision, such as gender and caste category, to prevent biased decision-making.
- **Promote Government Benefit Schemes:** Ensure that loan decisions are based on objective criteria rather than personal biases or stereotypes and facilitate the equitable distribution of government support schemes for women and minorities.
- **Address Bias in Loan Approval:** Employ homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs to enable bank officers to verify applicant eligibility without accessing confidential data.

## Technical Approach
- **Homomorphic Encryption:** Utilize homomorphic encryption to protect sensitive personal information during data transfer and computation. This enables the bank officer to verify the applicant's eligibility without decrypting the data.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Zero-knowledge proofs allow the system to verify the applicant's identity and financial information without disclosing the underlying data, safeguarding privacy and preventing unauthorized access.

## System Benefits
- **Privacy Protection:** The system protects sensitive personal information from unauthorized access and prevents biased decision-making based on non-relevant factors.
- **Fairer Loan Approvals:** Loan decisions are based on objective criteria, such as the applicant's financial history and repayment capacity, promoting equitable access to financial services.
- **Inclusive Financial Inclusion:** The system facilitates the equitable distribution of government benefit schemes for women and minorities, contributing to economic empowerment and social progress.
